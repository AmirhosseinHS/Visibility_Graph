# Analysis of Visibility Graph Algorithm in Periodic Data

(Nima Rafizadeh, Amirhossein Hajigholam Saryazdi)

In this study, we analyze the performance of the visibility algorithm on hourly electricity data from the state of New York that exhibits periodic behavior. To accomplish this, we propose a simple method for capturing the similarity between nodes in a periodic time series by connecting them to the same hour and day of the week and then comparing its performance to the corresponding visibly graph. To be more specifics, we address this issue by creating different graphs including a visibility graph, a visibility graph with connecting the same hour, a visibility graph with connecting the same hour and day of week, and a graph connecting the same hour and day of week. We then obtain features for pairs of nodes using two distinct methods including a set of similarity measures and Node2Vec. To compare the performance of each graph in link prediction, the extracted features are fed into machine learning models such as random forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Our findings indicate that as we incorporate the hour and day of the week into the graph-building process, the accuracy improves.
